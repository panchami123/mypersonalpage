        <p>On any give day, you will always find somthing beautiful,
        something worth remembering and for the same reason I like to

        <h4>Read and review novels</h4>
        <br>
        <p> Reading books is one of the few things that gets me really involved.
          I'm fine with any genre as long as its written well but my fav are crime thrillers and mystery.

        <h4>Catch up a good show!</h4>

        <p>No, I'm not someone who binge watches series.
        But I do like watching shows and movies once in a while.   </p>
